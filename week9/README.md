In this week program, using Python+numpy, we are implementing a program that takes as input an array of characters (the characters from Pride and Prejudice, for example), normalizes to UPPERCASE, ignores words smaller than 2 characters and stope words, and replaces characters with their Leet  counterparts when there is a one-to-one mapping. 
Here we learn more about Leet.
Then, the program prints out the 5 most frequently occurring 2-grams. (2-grams are all 2 consecutive words in a sequence)

To execute this program, on `shell`, run the following commands from the current directory:
- `python3 Three.py pride-and-prejudice.txt`
